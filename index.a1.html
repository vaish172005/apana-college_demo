    <h2>Enjoy The Moment</h2>
    <p><strong>It's being present without letting your worries about the future</strong>Just like <u>self-care</u> isn’t all bubble baths and extra dessert, living in the moment doesn’t have to mean going on a yoga retreat. <em>It’s not a choice of real life or your best life.</em> It’s a habit of bringing awareness and compassion into your day-to-day.
